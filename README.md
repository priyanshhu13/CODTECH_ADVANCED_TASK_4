## Introduction
The **Advanced Encryption Tool** is a secure application designed to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES algorithm with customizable hash algorithms. This tool provides both a command-line and a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless file encryption and decryption.

---

## Features
- **Command-line interface** for quick operations.
- **Graphical user interface** (GUI) built with Tkinter and CustomTkinter for ease of use.
- Supports multiple hash algorithms: MD5, SHA256, SHA512, and SHA1.
- Padding to ensure encryption compatibility.
- Encryption with secure salt and IV generation.
- Visual progress and user feedback for operations.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Cryptographic Libraries**:
  - `cryptography` for AES encryption.
  - `hashes` for hash algorithm support.
- **GUI Libraries**:
  - `tkinter` for core GUI.
  - `customtkinter` for enhanced styling.
- **Others**:
  - `pyfiglet` for ASCII art in CLI.
  - `colorama` for colored CLI output.
